# Printer cabinet
This is a little open hardware project aimed to facilitate making of a 3D printer enclosure, 
using only easily accessible materials along with some 3d printed parts. Most of the design 
was done with Prusa i3 MK2 in mind, but of course will work with any printer of similar size.

## Required materials
**Enclosure**
*(the structure shielding and holding the printer and other modules in place)*

- 2x Ikea LACK table
- 4x plexiglass sheet 420x470x4mm
- Bunch of 2.5x16mm wood screws
- Bunch of 4x16mm wood screws

**Supervision**
*(external safety, supervision and remote control module)*

- Raspberry Pi Zero W
- Raspberry Pi Zero camera
- One wire digital temperature sensor, such as DS18B20
- Digital smoke sensor, such as MQ-2
- Solid state relay 
- AC250V, >=10A relay module
